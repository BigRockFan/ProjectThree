BackEndDeveloper README for Project Three (CS400 @ UW Madison)

Team: red

Files Written by Me:
--------------------
<List all files that were within this project that were written by you, and
 include a short description of the purpose that each file servers>

BackendInterface.java - Serves as an interface of the backend class which I created a few days later. The purpose of this file was to give the other teammates a good idea of what methods I would be implementing along with a good framework to help me organize my own methods. It also helped when the frontend developer wanted to make a dummy backend class.

Backend.java - Serves as the backbone of the project. It uses a directed, weighted graph to hold data about each airport in the flight tracker app. At the same time, it carries out all the functions that the app should be able to do (specifically using Dijkstra's algorithm effectively) as explained in the proposal document. The frontend is able to access all the methods and expose the functionality in this class to the user.

Additional Contributions:
-------------------------
<List any additional contributions that you have made toward your team's
 completion of this project.  This might include, but is not limited to things
 like: organizing team communication, creating extra tests or dummy classes,
 assisting team members in any way, etc.>

Cleaned up code after everyone finished their individual classes in order for the application to work bug-free. Also created a DataReaderDummy to test implementation of the backend.
