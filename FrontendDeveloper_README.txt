Files Written by Me:
--------------------
<List all files that were within this project that were written by you, and
 include a short description of the purpose that each file servers>

Frontend.java: 
The file is where the program is run and the class, method, and file references are called (through the main method). 
It puts together all the code of the other programmers in an understandable way for the user to interact with the application.
It provides commands and works with the user to make use of the application.

FrontEndDeveloperTests.java:
This file serves as the test suite for the Frontend.java file. It ensures that the commands work as intended and messages are output to the user correctly. 
It uses JUnit5 to accomplish this.

Additional Contributions:
-------------------------
<List any additional contributions that you have made toward your team's
 completion of this project.  This might include, but is not limited to things
 like: organizing team communication, creating extra tests or dummy classes,
 assisting team members in any way, etc.>

I made a Backend dummy class so that I could begin implementing the frontend part of the project. I assisted the data wrangler in creating an airport class that fit the
program needs in terms of compatibility.
